# Usage
Connect Servos
Begin by attaching the servo motors to the designated joints on the robotic arm. Ensure a secure and stable connection, as the smooth operation of the arm will depend on the proper installation of the servo components.

# Arduino Setup
With the servos in place, proceed to connect them to an Arduino board. This will provide the necessary control interface to operate the robotic arm. Carefully follow the wiring instructions and then upload the provided control code to the Arduino to enable full functionality.

# Test Movements
After completing the hardware setup and uploading the control software, it's time to test the movements of the robotic arm. Run the basic test scripts to verify that all joints are operating as expected, with smooth and accurate motion across the full range of motion. This validation step will help you identify and troubleshoot any issues before proceeding with more advanced applications.

By methodically working through these three key steps - connecting the servos, setting up the Arduino, and testing the movements - you will be well on your way to successfully deploying and utilizing this robust and versatile 5-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. This careful approach will ensure a seamless integration and unlock the full potential of this remarkable project.
